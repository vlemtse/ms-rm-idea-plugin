# Role Model Preview Plugin - Summary

## Plugin Structure

We've created a complete IntelliJ IDEA plugin with the following structure:

### Configuration Files
- `build.gradle` - Gradle build configuration
- `settings.gradle` - Gradle settings
- `gradle.properties` - Plugin properties
- `src/main/resources/META-INF/plugin.xml` - Plugin configuration

### Java Classes

#### YAML Data Models (in `com.example.yaml` package)
- `Permission.java` - Represents a permission
- `PermissionGroup.java` - Represents a permission group
- `Role.java` - Represents a role in the role model
- `RoleModel.java` - Root object for role model YAML
- `DictionaryRole.java` - Represents a role in the dictionary
- `SudirRole.java` - Represents a Sudir role with platform and role codes
- `RoleDictionary.java` - Root object for role dictionary YAML

#### Service Classes (in `com.example.service` package)
- `YamlParserService.java` - Handles parsing of YAML files

#### Plugin Components (in `com.example` package)
- `RoleModelPreviewEditorProvider.java` - Editor provider that creates the preview
- `RoleModelPreviewFileEditor.java` - File editor implementation
- `RoleModelPreviewPanel.java` - UI panel that displays the preview

#### Test Classes (in `src/test/java/com/example` package)
- `YamlParserServiceTest.java` - Basic unit tests

### Example Files
- `example_role_model.yaml` - Sample role model file
- `example_role_dictionary.yaml` - Sample role dictionary file

## How It Works

1. When a user opens a file named `role_model.yaml`, the plugin's `RoleModelPreviewEditorProvider` creates a preview editor.
2. The `RoleModelPreviewPanel` parses both the role model file and the role dictionary file (located at `../role_dictionary.yaml`).
3. It resolves all permissions associated with each role, including those from permission groups.
4. It displays a formatted preview showing:
   - Role header with platform code and role code from the dictionary
   - All permissions associated with each role

## Building the Plugin

To build the plugin, you'll need to:

1. Install Gradle on your system
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Run `gradle buildPlugin`
4. The plugin ZIP file will be created in `build/distributions/`

## Installing the Plugin

1. In IntelliJ IDEA, go to `Settings` > `Plugins` > `Install Plugin from Disk`
2. Select the generated ZIP file
3. Restart IntelliJ IDEA
